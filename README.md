# Mechanisms of Action Classification

This project predicts 206 targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) response(s) of different samples, given 875 features such as gene expression data and cell viability data. Features g- signify gene expression data, and c- signify cell viability data. cp_type indicates samples treated with a compound (cp_vehicle) or with a control perturbation (ctrl_vehicle); control perturbations have no MoAs; cp_time and cp_dose indicate treatment duration (24, 48, 72 hours) and dose (high or low). The training data includes 2,3814 unique samples ("sig_id").
